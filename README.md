# SCDAA
The code annotation in our ipynb files describes all the information about the code including the function of each part and demonstation about each problem. The analysis of the outcome can be seen in our report(pdf file).
The following points need to be explainedï¼š
1. Our main file is "Final_ver.ipynb". This file consists of all the code and most of the output except ex1.2 and ex3.
2. The sample size and time steps given by the question stem of ex1.2 is too large and we've been running for several hours and still can't get any results. Thus, we reduce some data by ourselves and get the results instead in ex1.2. This results can be seen at the end of the file "Ex1_updated.ipynb". 
3. The outcome of ex3 takes up too much space so we seperate it to the file "Ex3_outcome.ipynb". The result can be seen at the end of this file. All previous code can be ommited.
